        <p id="aboutbaking">Have you ever baked or cooked before? It's fun right? If you haven't baked before then you're in for a treat! Get it? <em>treat?</em> Oh well, let's get started. I have baked many things, such as cakes. I've done chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. I have baked cupcakes with the flavors of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and devil's food cake. I have also made chocolate chip cookies and crossiants. I can make ice cream and have made vanilla cakes from scratch. I also mix the cakes such as vanilla and strawberry. I also make a lot of banana bread. I really want to make red velvet, mango cake, and rose cake one day. I have cooked omelet, paneer chili, and scrambled eggs. I have also made dal rice. Check out the dessert I really want to make: <a href="https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/red_velvet_cupcakes_with_cream_cheese_frosting/" target="_blank">Red Velvet Cupcakes</a>!</p>

        <h1>My Inspiration</h1>
        <p>What's my inspiration to cook? I just have fun when I am creating food, also I love to eat good food! From cakes to curries, I want to learn to cook them all and when I'm done, I'll eat them along with my family! I also love to watch cooking and baking shows, I want to be able to bake like them!For example, MasterChef India makes cool things and gives lots of tips and tricks for cooking and baking. Nailed It! also gives some tips and tells you how to make the challenges, the contestants do not do so good, but I learn from their mistakes.</p>

    <section id="tips">
        <p>I've had some mess-ups here and there. Some of them were messy, so if you don't want to be cleaning a whole lotta butter, read these tips.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Be careful when you open the bag of flour</li>
            <li>Don't put the butter in the microwave for a long time. Put it in for a few seconds at a time(30 sec), otherwise it will burst everywhere.</li>
            <li>Mix carefully, it might spill.</li>
            <li>Be careful with the blender.</li>
            <li>Melt and put in the butter last or mix it in right after you pour it. Once, I put it in and did not mix it, and it hardened, so I couldn't mix it.(If it does happen, try to put the bowl on the stovetop(if you can!)for a few seconds.)</li>
            <li>Don't put metal stuff in the microwave! It's very dangerous. No metal spoons, forks, bowls, knives, etc.</li>
            <li>Careful with knives when chopping up stuff.</li>
            <li>Add your own spin to recipes. Bananas on top of the banana bread, maybe some walnuts. Sugar on the cupcakes. Something like that.</li>
            <li>Always double check the temprature and the amount of time it's supposed to be in before putting the food in.</li>
        </ol>
